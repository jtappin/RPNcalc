RPNcalc

rpncalc is a Revese Polish logic scientific calculator application that
is built using the GtkFortran libraries
<https://github.com/vmagnin/gtk-fortran/wiki>.

It should work equally well with late 2.x and the 3.0 versions of Gtk+.

WARNING:
	On 24 Jan 2013, the executable name (and other name stems) were
	changed from "rpncalc" to "RPNcalc" to avoid a clash with an
	existing CLI calculator also called rpncalc. You are advised to
	uninstall the old version before updating your sources.
